# BezierCurve
Bezier Curve With Dragging Feature using Mouse Motion
Above is the CodeBlocks Project of Beizer Curve in OpenGL framework.First make this code build and run and then choose any four arbitrary points in OpenGL window to contsruct a cubic bezier curve.
Then this code will provide you functionality of dragging those four points in the same window using your mouse and hence you can obtain a different bezier curve depending on the relative position of your control points.
